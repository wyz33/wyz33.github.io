title: Culture Shock - First Week of Metis Data Science Bootcamp
---


>**Culture shock:** The feeling of disorientation experienced by someone who is suddenly subjected to an unfamliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes.  
   
This is exactly how I would describe my first week as a student in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. 

Prior to Metis, I had just completed my PhD degree in Neuroscience. As a scientist in a neurophysiology lab, I did my fair share of gathering and processing data. *"How different could it be?"* I thought, *"Data is data..."* 

Famous last words, as they say. In fact, I think the best way to sum up what I have experienced and learned during the first week of bootcamp is to list all the differences between data science and academic research. 

#####Difference 1: The Expectations
Before I decided on my PhD thesis project, I had spent years studying the subject of interest, narrowing the question down as I gained more expertise. By the time I was ready to start my experiments(and collecting data), I had become the handful of people in the world that had thought about the topic so deeply and thoroughly.

Compare that to my first day at Metis when we were assigned our first project (To create a proposal for a hypothetical client who want to solicit emails at MTA stations): I barely know how to program in Python, had a vague idea of what Pandas is (aside from the fuzzy type), and the only thing I know about the MTA is that the trains are a nightmare on the weekends. I had no expert knowledge, I barely have the tools, and ***they want my recommendations? IN FOUR DAYS?!***.

As the week progressed, it dawned on me that as a data scientist, I was expected to dive into a new problem with little notice, and be able to draw insights from the data at hand. All I had was the data collected by the turnstiles. Now let's talk about the data.

#####Difference 2: The Data
In grad school, I spent most of my days running experiments and collecting data. I collected the data with specific hypotheses in mind. I know the format of the data collected. I personally perform each of the experiments so I know exactly the condition under which the data is collected, and which data should be discarded when something goes wrong. 

*This is not the luxury that was afforded us budding data scientists...* 

The MTA dataset is collected continuously and automatically by individual turnstiles (who knew?!). The dataset is huge and messy: most turnstiles count up, but a random few count down, no one is there to record when each turnstile resets or malfunctions. All this results in unpredictable quirks and out-right errors in the data, and it's up to us to find them, and either fix or remove them. 

Being so used to pristine data sets, this is perhaps the most striking and most frustrating difference between the two fields. However, it was incredibly satisfying when I was able to clean the data, process it, and finally draw some knowledge from it. 


#####Difference 3: The People
In grad school, people you spend the most time with (people who are in the same lab as you) think in very similar ways. This was somewhat inevitable when we all read the same text books and published papers, and were all under the tutelage of the same mentor.

Bootcamp students were the polar opposite of that: we had people from all different backgrounds: economics, business, physics, engineering, biomedical science, and even ancient language!! This variety in backgroun and experience expressed itself in the most incredible manner when we were given the same project and dataset: it was amazing to see all the unique ways people tackled the question. 

######End of week 1
I dispaired, I learned, I lost and regained confidence in myself... This emotional cyle is certainly similar whenever I take on a new endeavor. All in all, week 1 of bootcamp has left me excited and cautiously hopeful. Here's to an exciting and fulfilling week 2!
